This code implemented a software-based error correcting code BCH (31,16), the algorithm runs on atmega128A and corrects upto 3-bits per 31-bits encoded message.
The code can be modified for other platforms as well.

### Summary of Encoder C Code 
#### Overview
The provided code is written in Embedded C and is designed for an AVR microcontroller (likely ATmega32), focusing on implementing an error-correcting code (BCH code) for encoding and decoding messages. It also includes UART communication for data transmission and uses timers for timing operations.

**Key Components and Functions**
***Initialization (Initialize() function)***

-Sets up parameters for the BCH code (n=31, k=16, t=3).
-Initializes the generator polynomial and other necessary variables.
**Encoding (EncoderBCH() function)**

-Implements systematic encoding using BCH code.
-Concatenates two characters into a 16-bit message.
-Applies polynomial operations in GF(2) (Galois Field of order 2) for multiplication, addition, and modulo operations.
-Converts encoded messages into a GF(32) polynomial format for transmission.
***Decoding (DecoderBCH() function)***

-Performs systematic decoding using BCH code principles.
-Corrects errors in the received messages by comparing with expected polynomials and applying correction algorithms.
-UART Communication

***Utilizes UART for serial communication.***
-Includes functions for transmitting data (transmit0(), transmit1()) and receiving data (Rxdata()).
Timer Usage

-Timer initialization (Timer1_init()) for precise timing operations.
-Handles timer interrupts (TIMER1_OVF_vect) for counting and timing operations.
***Utility Functions***

-Various utility functions such as bit manipulation (getBit()), array operations (Bits2Bytes(), GF32Init(), TransArray()), and long integer conversions (TransLong()).
Hardware Interaction

-Direct interaction with hardware ports (PORTA) for digital signal transmission using Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK).
***Main Functionality***

-The main() function orchestrates the overall functionality.
-Calls initialization routines.
-Likely interfaces with other sensors or peripherals (not fully shown).
**Conclusion**
The code integrates error-correcting techniques (BCH) into an AVR microcontroller environment, focusing on reliable data transmission over potentially noisy communication channels. It leverages low-level operations for efficient memory and processing usage typical in embedded systems applications.
